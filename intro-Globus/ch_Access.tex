\chapter{Access to Globus}

The Globus platform enables developers to provide robust file transfer,
 sharing and search capabilities within their own research data 
applications and services, while leveraging advanced identity management, 
single sign-on, and authorization capabilities.

\section{Log in with your institution}\label{login}

Visit \href{https://www.globus.org}{www.globus.org} and click \emph{Login} 
at the top of the page. On the Globus login page, choose an organization
 you are already registered with, such as your school or your employer.
Alternatively, one could directly navigate to 
\href{https://www.globus.org/app/login}{https://www.globus.org/app/login}.

When you find it, click \emph{Continue}. If you cannot find your 
organization in the list please contact the support team at 
\globusinfo.

You will be redirected to your organization's login page. 
Use your credentials for that organization to login.

If that is your first time logging into Globus 
some organizations may ask for your permission to 
release your account information to Globus. In most cases 
that would be a one-time request.

Once you have logged in with your organization, Globus will 
ask if you would like to link to an existing account. If this 
is your first time logging in to Globus, click \emph{Continue}. 
If you have already used another account with Globus, you can 
choose \emph{Link to an existing account}.

You may be prompted to provide additional information such as 
your organization and whether or not Globus will be used for 
commercial purposes. Complete the form and click \emph{Continue}.

Finally, you need to give Globus permission to use your identity 
to access information and perform actions (like file transfers) on your behalf.
